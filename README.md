# Task App
Everybody needs to have built a Todo App in their lives, right? Well, here is mine, work in progress. It's a React/Redux App with a Rails backend for persistence. For now you can create, update, edit, and delete todos and projects and a little more.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the project to your computer with `git clone https://github.com/amelieoller/task-app`
2. Open it and run `foreman start` in your terminal
3. You should be able to visit the app at `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser
